### Your task 😀

 1. Open the prepared [Tailwind play](https://play.tailwindcss.com/mBsLfQ7yCU?layout=horizontal) example
 2. Style the given HTML elements (paragraph and button) with the help of tailwinds utility classes.
 Feel free to be as creative as you want to be! Have a look on the [Cheat sheet](https://tailwindcomponents.com/cheatsheet/) to know what is possible (~10min)
 3. Make a screenshot of your card and copy it 
 4. Open the online whiteboard conceptboard via [this link](https://app.conceptboard.com/board/hzmd-10fh-zpro-0rm4-n4hc) and enter as a guest. You can find the password in the e-portolio announcement channel on discord
 5. Paste your image (Strg + V) there
 6. If you want add a sticky note on the board above your card with your name on it. On the picture below you see how to do that.
 

> Only create these two objects (card + sticky note), because there is only memory capacity for 100 objects!
